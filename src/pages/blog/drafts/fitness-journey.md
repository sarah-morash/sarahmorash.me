Welcome to my workout series! After High School was over and I was no longer playing rugby, there was a period of time where I wasn't working out too much, and wasn't taking good care of my body (hello university and freshman 15!). I slowly started to get into Zumba classes, along with some other cardio classes like step/spin class, but I really feel like my jouney began when I decided to start taking personal training at Goodlife fitness.

This is where I really tried to zone in on my nutrition and weight training. My personal trainer Sascha really helped me to become comfortable at the gym which gave me the confidence to try new things. After my personal training was over, I took a leap of courage and decided to try crossfit which is where I developed a lot of barbell techniques (along with meeting the love of my life <3).

Most recently, I decided to try more of a powerlifting/bodybuilding type training style (also because crossfit can be quite expensive). I follow [Meg Squats Stronger by the Day online programming](https://www.strongstrongfriends.com/online-plans/) and go to [O2 Wellness](https://o2wellness.ca/). This has been a great combo for me considering that I currently work in the same location as the gym, the price is very reasonable, and I get to focus on the types of training that are my favourite.

If you are looking to start working out and don't have a sweet idea where to start, or just looking for some general inspiration/tips, you've come to the right place. Check back here for more posts in this series!
