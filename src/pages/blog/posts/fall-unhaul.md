The change from summer to fall has made me consider what I have to wear for my fall wardrobe.
I have made a few new purchases, but I also realize that an apartment only has so much space, and it's better to see the clothes you own to decide what you will wear instead of rumaging through piles of clothes, some which you haven't warn for years ðŸ™„I figured it was time to do a fall un-haul and get rid of some of these clothes!

There are so many ways to get rid of clothes that don't fit you/you won't wear anymore. Here are a few examples of what you could do with them:

- Donate clothes to your local Salvation Army/Goodwill Store
- If they are in great condition - sell them online! Many people choose this option by either making use of Kijiji or the Facebook Marketplace.
- Consign! This is great for those pieces that are name brands and in excellent condition. Consignment shops buy clothes that are name brand/in good condition and then sell them in their store.
- Donate your clothes to another cause - H&M has a garment collection program where they will take a bag of your used clothing and reuse/recycle it to use again, and will give you a coupon for money off of your next purchase!
- For the crafty folk - make those clothes new again by spicing them up, create something new out of them like a headband or bag, or turn your old clothes into rags for cleaning use.

I decided my best bet would be to sort out my piles of clothes into the ones I will not wear again, and then split them out into clothes that should really just be given away, and pieces that hold enough value that I could potentially consign. Although I could sell them individually online, it's not a great idea for someone who is already busy enough in their day-to-day live, so I thought to make it as easy as possible for myself :)

I ended up with 4 bags of clothing (about 8-10 pieces of clothes in each), and about 5 pieces that seems in good enough condition to consign. I took my bags to H&M where I ended up getting 5 coupons (1 extra!) so I can use them for future purchases at their store (maybe a Fall wardrobe piece I don't already have, or a versatile piece I could use year-round? The possibilities are endless ðŸ˜œ). It has made our walk-in closet so much cleaner, and makes me feel so much better knowing that these pieces will be reused to make something else instead of simply being discarded.
