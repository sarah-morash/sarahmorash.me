                <h3>10 Facts About Me</h3>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    My name is Sarah, I live in Halifax NS, and I have been
                    working in the technology industry for over 6 years.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I graduated from Dalhousie with a BCS (Co-op) and a minor in
                    Mathematics in 2015.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I love Crossfit and Powerlifting. My favourite strength
                    training exercises are bench press and deadlifts, and my
                    favourite WODs (workout of the days) are long AMRAPs (as
                    many reps as possible).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I love music. I took performance flute courses in
                    University, and also sang/performed in my spare time through
                    various organizations like Dalhousie University and The
                    Halifax Music Co-op. I've also volunteered for the Halifax
                    Jazz Festival and the Halifax Pop Explosion.
