              <h3>10 Facts About Me</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  My name is Sarah, I live in Halifax NS, and I have been
                  working in the technology industry for over 6 years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I graduated from Dalhousie with a BCS (Co-op) and a minor in
                  Mathematics in 2015.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I love Crossfit and Powerlifting. My favourite strength
                  training exercises are bench press and deadlifts, and my best
                  WODs (workout of the days) are long AMRAPs, as I'm generally
                  pretty good at pacing myself!
                </li>
                <li>
                  I love music. I took performance flute courses in University,
                  and also sang/performed in my spare time through various
                  organizations like Dalhousie University and The Halifax Music
                  Co-op. I've also volunteered for the Halifax Jazz Festival and
                  the Halifax Pop Explosion.
                </li>
                <li>

                  mentor for Canada Learning Code and also attend the monthly
                  Halifax React Meetup.
                </li>

                  I love to be creative. I love making paintings, as well as
                  papern and digital designs like posters and cards.
                </li>

                <li>
